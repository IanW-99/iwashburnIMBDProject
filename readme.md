Sprint 3 will grab information of the most popular movies from the imdb database api and store 
them into the database 'imDataBase.db'. The movies with the best and worst rank changes will have thier user 
rating data retrieved and stored in ratingsMovieData. There are two automated tests that will test to make 
sure that all the items are received from the api and that they are successfully stored in the database.

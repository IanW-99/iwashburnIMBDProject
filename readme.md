Sprint 4 introduces a GUI which will display data and analytics to the user. The data is taken from the imdb api and
stored in the local database 'imDatabase.db'. Users are given the option to either update the data in the database or 
view a variety of data visualizations. Requirements.txt contains all the necessary imports and installations needed to 
properly run this program.

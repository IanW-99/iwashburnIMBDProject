Sprint 2 will grab information of tv shows from the imdb database api and store 
them into the database 'imDataBase.db'. The database contains two tables,
headlineData and ratingData. The headlineData table stores information about the top 250 Tv shows. The ratingData table 
stores information about the user ratings of a few specific shows. There are two automated tests that will test to make 
sure that all the items are received from the api and that they are successfully stored in the database.
